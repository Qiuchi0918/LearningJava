The javac compiler always looks for files in the current directory, but the java
virtual machine launcher only looks into the current directory if the “.”
directory is on the class path. If you have no class path set, this is not a
problem—the default class path consists of the “.” directory. But if you have
set the class path and forgot to include the “.” directory, your programs will
compile without error, but they won’t run.

Some people recommend to set the CLASSPATH environment variable
permanently. This is generally a bad idea. People forget the global setting, and
are surprised when their classes are not loaded properly. A particularly
reprehensible example is Apple’s QuickTime installer in Windows. For several
years, it globally set CLASSPATH to point to a JAR file it needed, but did not
include the current directory in the classpath. As a result, countless Java
programmers were driven to distraction when their programs compiled but
failed to run.
