However, a Java implementation may, if it chooses, wrap commonly occurring values into identical
objects, and thus the comparison might succeed. This ambiguity is not what you want. The remedy is to
call the equals method when comparing wrapper objects.

The autoboxing specification requires that boolean, byte, char â‰¤ 127, short, and int between -
128 and 127 are wrapped into fixed objects. For example, if a and b had been initialized with 100
in the preceding example, then the comparison would have had to succeed.
